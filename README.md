## Why
For our capstone project our team is building an bottom bracket for the [Veemo](https://www.velometro.com/veemo/) (Enclosed Electric Bike) with integrated angular position detection of the crank arm. To validate our optical encoder built from scratch I built this tool so that we can compare readings from the arduino to the actual motion of the spindle/crank arm.
